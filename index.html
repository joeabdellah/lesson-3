        <h1>Is this making sense?</h1>

        <p>This will serve as a little exercise to see how well all this stuff is clicking, in addition to getting you comfortable with some more advanced styling techniques. This is a screenshot of a site.</p>

        <h2>1. Some boxes in a row.</h2>

        <p>Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.</p>
 
        <div>B</div>
        <div>L</div>
        <div>O</div>
        <div>C</div>
        <div>K</div>
        <div>S</div>
        <div>!</div>

        <h2>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h2>

        <img src=images/cat.jpeg>
        <p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like width: 100%;. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like font-family: monospace;.</p>


        <h2>3. This is a big link.</h2>
        <p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css. </p>
