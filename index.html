            <h2>1. Some boxes in a row.</h2>
            <p>Here’s a bunch of boxes <i>floated</i> next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.</p>
            <div class="gray">B</div>

            <h2>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h2>
            <p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like <small>width: 100%;</small>. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like font-family: monospace;.</p>
            <img src="images/cat.jpg" width="98%">

            <h2>3. This is a big link.</h2>
            <p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.</p>
            <div class="Google"><a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Take me to Google</a></div>
